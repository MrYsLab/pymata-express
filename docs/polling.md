# Processing Input Data

Before discussing the API, understanding how both Firmata generates input data 
notification messages, as well as 
how pymata-express processes these messages, may be
beneficial in designing your application. Understanding the
differences between using a callback versus polling is 
crucial when designing your application.

## Firmata Data Collection

Both the FirmataExpress and StandardFirmata sketches poll all input pins within the *loop method*
of the sketch.

Firmata builds notification messages containing the pin number, pin type, and data value,
 and transmits these messages to pymata-express
over the serial link.

## Firmata Data Polling

### Digital Input
For digital input pins, all the pins are polled with *each* iteration of the sketch *loop*,
with no delays. If the state of a pin has changed since the last loop iteration,
Firmata creates a notification message and transmits the message over the serial link
to pymata-express.

### Analog Input
For analog input pins, each pin is polled, and its current value is reported,
regardless of change. 
All analog input pins are nominally polled every 19 milliseconds.

### I2C Input

Unlike digital and analog inputs, most I2C devices report values only when a read request is issued 
 to the i2c device. For these i2c devices, a read request results in a single reply. 

Some i2c devices may be placed in a continuous read mode. In this
mode, the i2c device automatically sends update notifications,
 usually as quickly as possible. When in continuous i2c mode, 
the Firmata *loop* retrieves cached responses at a nominal polling rate of 19 milliseconds.

### Sonar (HC-SR04) Input
FirmataExpress supports HC-SR04 type distance sensors. The Firmata *loop* polls each device 
and reports its current value regardless of change.
The polling rate is nominally every 40 milliseconds for HC-SR04 type devices.


## Using Pymata-Express To Access Input Data

### *Polling* For Input Data Changes
As pymata-express receives input data notifications, 
it caches the data in internal data structures. These data structures retain
the value reported as well as the time of occurrence.
The application may query or poll these data structures to obtain the
latest data updates for a given pin. 

The pymata-express API methods that implement polling are:

* analog_read
* digital_read
* i2c_read_saved_data
* sonar_read

A more efficient and automatic way for your application to be notified
of data updates is to use the pymata-express *callback* feature. 

### Using *Callbacks* Instead Of Polling
Callback notification is much more efficient than using polling.

A callback is simply a function or method written by you, that is called automatically
by pymata-express when it receives an input data notification message from Firmata.

You may optionally *register* callback functions when using any of the following pymata-express API
methods:

* set_pin_mode_analog_input
* set_pin_mode_digital_input
* set_pin_mode_digital_input_pullup
* set_pin_mode_sonar
* enable_analog_reporting (an alias for set_pin_mode_analog_input)
* i2c_read
* i2c_read_continuous
* i2c_read_restart_transmission

You may write a callback function for each input pin, write
a callback function to handle any pin of single type, such as analog input
or digital input, or even have a single callback function handle all input data notifications.

You may use callbacks with some pins while using polling for others. Polling is available
for all input pins whether callbacks are in use or not.

A callback function is specified to accept a single input parameter, typically named
***data***. The input parameter will be filled with a list when pymata-express invokes the callback.
A description of what is contained in the list
is provided in the 
[reference API.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/html/pymata_express/index.html)

```python
def my_callback(data):
    """
    :param data: a list containing pin type, pin number, 
                 data value and time-stamp
    """
# Your code goes here to process the data
```

**TIP**: You should keep callback functions as short as possible. If processing callback
data within the callback function results in blocking your application, 
you may wish to consider spawning a separate
processing thread.
